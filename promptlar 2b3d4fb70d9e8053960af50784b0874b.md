# 11. Trump Güvenlik Kamerası

```html
Donald Trump taking a selfie, as captured directly from a security camera monitor in an authentic New York City bodega. The image should look like a raw screenshot or photo of a CRT or LCD security monitor, displaying Trump's reflection as he takes the selfie. He should be holding a smartphone up. The security camera's wide-angle lens distortion should be evident, making the foreground slightly bulbous and the background receding. The bodega interior should be densely packed with brightly lit, colorful product shelves, giving a stark, almost surveillance-like feel. Include on-screen text overlays like 'RECORDING IN PROGRESS' or a similar security system message, and a subtle timestamp. The overall aesthetic should be high-contrast, slightly grainy, and reminiscent of a low-fidelity security feed.
```

![image.png](image%2011.png)

# 12. Trump Photo Booth

```html
"A full-screen screenshot of a MacBook Photo Booth application, showing Donald Trump inside the webcam frame. He is on his private jet, looking directly at the camera with a slight, unpolished expression, as if caught mid-moment. The image inside the Photo Booth window should have the distinctive wide-angle lens distortion, slightly overexposed flash, and the muted, slightly green-tinted color cast characteristic of early 2000s webcams. Include the 'Photo Booth' title at the top of the window, the 'Photo Booth' pixelated text overlay, a date stamp like 'OCT 26 2006', and the familiar Photo Booth control buttons at the bottom. The background of the private jet interior should be visible behind him, slightly distorted by the lens effect."
```

![image.png](image%2012.png)

# 13. Trump Kaykay

```html
Donald Trump skateboarding, captured with the exact, unmistakable aesthetic of a Sony VX1000 camcorder using a fisheye lens. The image should feature: Extreme wide-angle fisheye distortion, with prominent barrel distortion and a dark, rounded vignette around the edges, as seen in the reference images. Low-resolution, grainy video still quality, with visible interlacing artifacts and a slightly 'fuzzy' or soft feel, rather than sharp, clean detail. Washed-out, slightly desaturated, and often subtly greenish or yellowish color cast, typical of older video cameras. Colors should not be vibrant. Harsh, natural lighting, with bright areas (like the sky or sun reflections) often blown out or extremely bright, creating strong contrast. Visible lens flare or light leaks when the sun is in frame or at an angle, characteristic of the VX1000 lens. A feeling of motion and raw, unpolished energy, as if captured from a fast-moving, handheld perspective during a skate session. Trump should be performing a skate trick or mid-motion on a skateboard, positioned prominently within the distorted fisheye frame against an urban or public space background (like a plaza or street). No date stamps, camera UI, or digital overlays. The final image must instantly evoke the nostalgic, raw, and underground vibe of early 2000s skate videos shot on a VX1000.
```

![image.png](image%2013.png)

# 14. Trump Özel Jet - Puro

```html
Donald Trump, sitting in a luxurious private jet, smoking a cigar. The image should be captured with flash photography on a Fujifilm 35mm film camera, exhibiting prominent film grain. The direct, slightly harsh flash lighting should create strong contrasts and highlights on Trump's face and the interior of the jet. The overall color palette should be muted and slightly desaturated with a subtle filmic warmth, and noticeable film grain should be a key textural element throughout the scene.
```

![image.png](image%2014.png)

# 15. Trump White House

```html
"A photograph of Donald Trump standing outside the White House, smoking a cigar. The image must look EXACTLY like it was taken on an original iPhone 3G (late 2000s). Replicate these definitive visual traits: Low resolution (640x480 ratio), resulting in a soft, slightly blurry image lacking fine detail, but without excessive, blocky pixelation. Subtle, fine digital noise/grain, present across the entire image, giving it a slightly textured, but not overwhelmingly "dirty" appearance. Limited dynamic range characterized by: Slightly blown-out highlights e.g. that lose subtle detail. Elevated black levels in shadows crushed blacks that aren't truly black, with minimal detail. Distinctive color rendering: Slightly desaturated and muted colors overall, lacking vibrancy. A subtle, consistent color cast or sometimes a touch cool/greenish, which gives the entire image a specific 'tint'. Greens (grass) will appear duller, blues (sky) less vivid. Soft focus due to the fixed-focus lens: nothing in the image will be pin-sharp; there will be a general, gentle blur across the entire frame. Pronounced chromatic aberration (color fringing) visible as subtle color halos red/cyan around high-contrast edges, especially on the White House architecture or tree branches against the sky. A casual, slightly uncentered, point-and-shoot composition, characteristic of early smartphone photography. No date stamps, camera UI, or artificial lens flares. The overall impression must be unmistakably 'early iPhone snapshot,' conveying a sense of nostalgia for that specific mobile camera quality

# 35. Hip-Hop Albüm Kapağı

```html
Authentic late 1990s / early 2000s hip-hop album cover, photographed look. Donald Trump in a confident, slightly menacing pose, wearing a dark suit, shot with a wide-angle lens, looking directly at the camera. He is positioned prominently in the foreground. Behind him, the White House is visible, shot from a slightly dramatic, low angle, with a dark, overcast, slightly ominous sky. The image has a gritty, high-contrast, slightly desaturated color palette, with deep shadows and strong highlights, typical of 90s photography. The album title, 'THE OVAL OFFICE', is rendered in large, impactful 3D chrome or metallic text, with a subtle bevel and glow, positioned across the top, looking like it's embossed or applied over the photograph. The artist name, 'DONALD J. TRUMP', is in a bold, blocky, slightly distressed sans-serif font, perhaps in a contrasting color or with a subtle drop shadow, at the bottom. The overall composition is dense and visually powerful, with a sense of raw, unpolished energy characteristic of classic hip-hop album art from that era. Square album cover format.

Use real world framing principles such as rule of thirds, true horizon placement, natural leading lines and authentic depth cues. No impossible angles or exaggerated elevation.",
"realisticSunPhysics": "Sun position must follow real-world solar physics. Golden hour sunlight must have a real azimuth between 15° and 35° above the horizon, depending on latitude and season. The sun's direction must match shadow orientation, material reflectivity and illumination falloff exactly as it would in true photography. Sky gradients must follow atmospheric Rayleigh scattering rather than artistic effects. No impossible sun directions or inconsistent shadows.",
"realisticDroneAltitude": "The drone altitude must stay within realistic flight limits. The camera viewpoint must represent a real, legal flight height between 30 meters and 150 meters depending on landscape and airspace restrictions. The horizon line, perspective compression, and foreground scale relationships must reflect a real, physically achievable drone altitude. No satellite-level views. No helicopter-level height unless legally plausible. Only real drone flight envelopes.",
"realisticSensorModeling": "Camera behavior must follow real sensor physics. Shutter speed must remain fast enough to freeze motion without unnatural sharpness. ISO must remain within clean native ranges to avoid artificial noise. Dynamic range must reflect real-world limits, preserving highlights and shadows without synthetic tone mapping. Color science must follow true RAW-to-Log interpretation with natural rolloff and realistic luminance values. No AI artifacts, HDR surrealism or synthetic enhancement.",
"detailLevel": "Detail must follow real optical behavior. Sharpness must be natural, not artificial. Surface textures must match real materials exactly as they appear from drone altitude. No invented micro details. No procedural textures. Foliage, rooftops, road markings and water surfaces must behave exactly like true aerial photographs.",
"stylization": "Zero stylization. Only real-life photographic tonality. Natural color reproduction. True dynamic range. Physically accurate exposure. No cinematic fantasy, no painterly effects, no stylized grades. Pure documentary-level realism.",
"camera": {
"equipment": "Professional cinema drone such as DJI Inspire 3 with Zenmuse X9 8K Air full frame camera.",
"lens": "DL 24mm F2.8 LS ASPH rectilinear wide-angle lens with zero distortion and real-world optical behavior.",
"perspective": "A physically achievable elevated oblique angle showcasing {INSERT_LANDMARK_NAME} as the central subject with perfect compositional clarity.",
"settings": "8K RAW-equivalent clarity, real-world shutter behavior for crisp motion freeze, native ISO for clean shadows and balanced exposure respecting real dynamic range without artificial enhancement."
}
"lighting": "Lighting must follow physical laws. Golden hour must produce soft warm light, long shadows and real color temperature transitions. Night lighting must follow authentic ambient and artificial light patterns from the actual location.",
"cloudsAndAtmosphere": "Clouds must be physically plausible, meteorologically correct and visually consistent with light direction. Atmospheric perspective must follow real distance-based contrast falloff, with no surreal haze or fantasy gradients.",
"background": "All geography, architecture and environment must match real-world present-day reality. No imagined buildings, no altered street layouts, no fictional coastline shapes. Everything must remain precisely authentic to the true location."
}
"negativePrompt": "hallucinated architecture, invented buildings, fictional modifications, impossible angles, unrealistic lighting, incorrect shadow direction, surreal clouds, neon skies, artificial bloom, painterly textures, CGI artifacts, false reflections, oversharpened edges, incorrect sun position, unrealistic altitude, warped geometry, incorrect city layout, fantasy weather"
